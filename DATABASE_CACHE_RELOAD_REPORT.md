## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED

### **Issue Found: ClassRoomSeeder Error**

```
Error: Unknown column 'code' in 'where clause'
Problem: Seeder was trying to use 'code' column that doesn't exist
```

### **Solution Applied**

```
✓ Removed reference to non-existent 'code' column
✓ Updated seeder to use 'school_id' + 'name' as identifier
✓ Simplified classroom data structure
✓ Seeder now works correctly
```

### **Before (Failed)**

```php
$school = School::firstOrCreate(
    ['code' => 'SMA'],  // ❌ No 'code' column
    ['name' => 'SMA Alwi College']
);
```

### **After (Success)**

```php
$school = School::firstOrCreate(
    ['name' => 'SMA Alwi College']  // ✅ Works!
);
```
