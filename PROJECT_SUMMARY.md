DELETE   → Admin delete with file cleanup

NEW: File download with auth check
NEW: ZIP download with error handling
NEW: Proper delete with logging
```

#### **2. Jadwal Pelajaran Management** ✅

```php
CREATE   → Admin generate daily jadwal
READ     → Admin/teacher/student view (role-based)
UPDATE   → Admin edit subject, time with validation
DELETE   → Admin delete with confirmation

NEW: Duplicate prevention in generate
NEW: Time conflict detection
NEW: Better error messages
NEW: Comprehensive logging
```

#### **3. Trip Guru Management** ✅

NEW: Duplicate date prevention
NEW: Modal form with proper routes
NEW: Try-catch error handling

```

#### **4. Payment Verification** ✅

```php

READ     → Admin view submissions
UPDATE   → Admin verify (approve/reject)
DELETE   → Admin delete records

NEW: Verified_by & verified_at tracking
NEW: Audit logging
NEW: Better error handling
NEW: User-friendly messages
```

### **Phase 1: Classroom System**

#### **Created 14 Classroom Rooms** ✅

```
Grade 10 (1): 1B
Grade 11 (7): A21, A22, A23, B21, B22, B23, B24
Grade 12 (6): A31, A32, B31, B32, B33, B34

Database: ClassRooms table with capacity & grade
Linked: To Lessons via class_room_id
Linked: To Students via class_room_id
```

#### **Setup Relationships** ✅

```
ClassRoom (1) ──→ (Many) Lesson
  ├─ date
  ├─ teacher_id
  ├─ subject_id
  ├─ start_time
  └─ end_time

ClassRoom (1) ──→ (Many) Student
